This folder contains the code and scripts for SMRS.  

SMRS is a higher education marketing company that wanted to employ data science into their business.  As part of a group of 4, we were tasked to create a baseline model that SMRS could use with their clients to predict the success of various marketing campaigns.  

This model was needed to be understood by non-technical users thus we chose a regression model where the coefficients were meaningful to SMRS and their clients.

The scripts folder contains some of the data cleaning and feature engineering that we did, while the models folder contains the training and executing of the models that we provided for SMRS.
